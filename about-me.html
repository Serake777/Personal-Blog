            <h2>My name is Serake and giving my life to Christ is the best decision I have ever made</h2>

            <p><strong>I was once lost and saparated from God</strong>. 
                I had been through a rough patch in my life and I had come to the conclusion that there 
                must be more to life than just money, pleasure and the busyness caused by trying to be successful. 
                My soul yearned for more and I needed a touch from my maker.
            </p>
            <p>When we come to know the Lord we often say that we have found Jesus and the truth is Jesus found us
                because we were lost and He has always been there, patiently waiting for us to come to Him.</p>

            <h3 class="bold-text">How I turned things around</h3>
            <p><strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I decided to give my life to God.
                I did not know what I was doing or how it would turn out, however what I did know is that I needed a saviour.
            </strong>. 
                I allowed the Word of God to take root in my life and be my guide to how I live life. 
                I learned to read the Bible and read faith based books to help me grow in understanding and living a life pleasing to God.</p>
            <p>It wasn't easy at all, but I God brought people in my life that would help me stay the course and walk the journey of life with.</p>

            <h3 class="bold-text">Now I walk by faith and not by sight</h3>
            <p>Now that I'm living for Jesus, the things I do in life have more meaning and purpose. 
            I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I am happily married to my beautiful wife who God blessed me with.</p>
            <p>With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like I had no choice but to 
            start sharing how I did it</strong>, and how others can turn their lives around so that they may be saved and be sure 
            that they will spend eternity with God, which is why I wrote this blog!</p>
